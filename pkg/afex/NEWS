					Changes in afex Version 0.3-x
					Released August/September 2012

	Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
	o	added function compare.2.vectors().
	
	o	Name of function univariate() changed to univ(), as
		a function with this name is part of package multcomp.
		This may leed to problems. Thanks to Florent Duyme for
		spotting this.
	
	o	added return argument to aov.car() and ez.glm().
	
	Bugfixes
	
	o	aov.car now uses do.call when calling lm() to avoid local
		variables in the call to lm() which could led to problems when
		working with the lm model.
